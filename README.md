# Bypass Me

This is a simple CTF challenge to byapass path traversal. Flag is just there as a placeholder and, to provide a dopamine kick to the person who bypassed it. Payload is what you're supposed to submit.

If you can bypass it, do raise an Issue.

And, if you have a better fix. Send a PR :)
